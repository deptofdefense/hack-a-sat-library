# HACK-A-SAT RESOURCE LIBRARY

A collection of Resources for budding SAT hackers (Satellites, not the test¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯). *Note: This is an evolving resource, so please [contribute](./HASlibrary-contribute-instrxns.md) with a pull request*

## BACKGROUND
The democratization of space has opened up a new frontier for exploration and innovation.  But with this opportunity, new cybersecurity vulnerabilities are also being created. One human can design, build and launch a satellite, adhering to very few standards and security protocols. So how can we achieve safe, reliable and trustworthy operations to truly realize the promise of space?  ...BY HACKING A SATELLITE.

The United States Air Force, in conjunction with the Defense Digital Service, presents this year’s Space Security Challenge, Hack-A-Sat. This challenge asks hackers from around the world to focus their skills and creativity on solving cybersecurity challenges on space systems... THE QUESTION IS, HOW?

## RESOURCES

### Hack A Sat Workshops
We are bringing a series of interactive workshops to DEF CON in complete Safemode via Twitch. Check out our vibrant, web-based virtual reality environment to access the workshops at [dds-virtual.com](https://dds-virtual.com/), otherwise, see the [github repo](https://github.com/deptofdefense/dds-at-DEFCON/blob/master/README.md) for the deets on game play for each of the work shops!
